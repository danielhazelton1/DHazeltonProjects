# Daniel Hazelton's Projects
This is a Git repository to show my projects! Please take a look and feel free to send me an email at DLHazelton1@outlook.com if you have a question!

- *bioretentiongardeningapp* is a web application that allows for volunteers to fill out a bioretention gardening form for research and maintenance of rain gardens in the pacific northwest. It uses HTML, Golang, and MariaDB. *BioretentionGardeningAppFinalReport.pdf* is the final report about the project given to my team's client who works for WSU.

- *KlicksRedesign* is a website created to test a redesign of Klicks, a website that allows for student input/interactions while in class. The redesign was tested for usability and ease of access. These tests are recorded in *UsabilityStudyReport*.

- *ASL_App* is a phone application that helps the user learn ASL (American Sign Language) using Swift. The app has a mode that cycles through images of ASL letters spelling a word. The user must input the word shown to them after all images have been cycled through. The speed in which the images change can be set by the user using a slider. Another mode is one that shows a word/phrase and the user must select the correct image of ASL that translates to the shown word/phrase. The app also has flashcards, a dictionary or words/phrases in the app, and links to ASL learning videos.
 
- *projectScheduler* is a Python project that I created in order to practice unit and integration testing. The project allows users to create a scuedule for personal project and set up events on a calender. 

- *AdDetector* is a machine learning algorithm that, by using a dataset of the properties of ads and non advertisment images on a webpage, can detect if a image is an ad or not with high accuacy. However the dataset used to test it is a little dated and the algorthim would need to be changed to adapt to more modern ads.

- *WSU_TA_assign* is a web application that could be used to assign Teaching Assistants (TAs) to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) courses at Washington State University (WSU). This was created as a final project in one of my college courses.
